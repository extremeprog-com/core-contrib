   - Help other contrubitors with projecting different features
   - Check pull requests from other contrubutors

3. Contributor-Coder
   - Code things he want
   - Code things from task-tracker
   - Clean-up pull requests after check
   - Pay attention to Architect opinion

6. Buster (e.g. manager)
   - Kick off contributors for doing of making decisions
   - Save contributors from other contributor's delays
   - Find new contributors

7. Pull request merger
   - collect feedback from different team members
   - merge requests of all
   - be responsible for project quality, and project development speed, and their balance

8. Discoverer
   - check and compare how other solution works for the same tasks

10. Real world ideologist
   - find how to light people about Core ideas
   - manage project entrance pages and project graphics
   - help to create project taxonomy


One contributor can merge several roles. One contributor can't merge conflict roles in one context (for example, check own pull-request, or be an arbuter in own dispute).

## Global goals and mission

1. Simplify app development, bring more automation to programming, save developers from boiler-plate code
2. Create better reusable libraries (Implementation and API Patterns for common things, like Players, Blogs, Comments, etc)
3. To become a new standard logic for App development. Extend support to many modern languages.
   <– create separate document for explaination how to design simple-portable Core implementations

## Project Artifacts

Current:
- Core.js v1
- Core.PHP (not supported)

Near future
- Core.JS v2
- Core.JS tutorial + understanding guide

Far future:
- Core Understanding Guide
- Core.JS + tutorial
- Core.Python + tutorial
- Core.Go + tutorial
- Core.CSharp + tutorial
- Core.C + tutorial
- Core.CPP + tutorial

## OS Diagrams

```
<– Create Core.JS v2
   <– Create list of features
      # Embedded testing framework, hierarchial contexts
      # Local scopes, hierarchial data storage for objects
      # Requsts, Events, Requests of Events
      # Static event listening
      # Serialization and custom Transports (for distributed applications)
      # NodeJS and BrowserJS support
      # Adapters for most popular frameworks: AngularJS, ReactJS, ...
   <– Create API design
   <– Create whole architecture
   <– Create description of each feature
   <– Create test framework architecture
      <– Create test examples
   <– Create implementation sequence
      <– Estimate features' usefulness and cost
   <– Implement features step-by-step
      <– Implement event listening sync/async and tests
         –> Implement embedded test framework
            –> Implement contexts
               -> ...
                  –> Implement request of events
                     ->
```

```
<– Find more contributors
   <– Recruit Buster
      <– Create Core Understanding guide
```


## Nearer milestones and middle-term goals

Rules: 

- each step should bring profit for end-user or contributors
- make too much steps simultaneously is not recommended for 1 people or a small group (1-3 is ok)


1. Make Core concepts clear to understanding by third-party people. Change Core.JS for being trusted by users.

   a. Create meaningful examples for Core.js
   b. Create good entrance page with laconic description and good examples for Core.js
   c. Create more advanced description of concepts.
   d. Create docs for features and corner-cases.
   e. Create test-framework and basic tests for Core.JS

2. Make Core.JS v2 a live project
   
   a. Create full design-concept of Core.JS v2
   b. Start implementing features
   c. Create more features to being helpful for real projects
   d. Test Core.JS v2 in real projects.
   e. Find more contributors for continue work.

3. Implement on other language
